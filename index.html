                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Juliet is a 21 year old from Nairobi,Kenya currently a student in Software Development in AkiraChix
                    based Nairobi.
                    Originally am from Kisii ,from a family of six ,one brother and two sisters and the first born
                    daughter.
                    Am passionate about tech and how tech has diverse and alot of opportunities to grow and model people
                    career wise.
                    I belive in growth and embracing learning as the joyful part of life which makes me believe I can do
                    it as long
                    as I can learn it,so theres nothing difficult to it.


                <p>Have gotten an opportunity to study partly in the city and the surbubs ,am glad have tasted
                    both of the experiences
                    enough to tell stories.Before getting into tech my intrest was to get into the medics field and
                    become a doctor or
                    a nurse because I thought they looked cool in their work outfits and for-go my chance to pursue
                    Infortation Technology at Co-operative University.I later shifted after realizing I could not
                    sacrifice
                    a whole career lifetime for cool outfits and thats when I realized my passion for doing tech and I
                    followed it in 2020.
                    Am a software developer student ,a Diploma and my dream is to take my masters at Stanford
                    University.Am motivated to created an ecommerce application through
                    the skills I will have received by the the end of this program but I have a website already still a
                    working progress.

                            time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first
                            place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a
                            woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being
                            raised solely for that purpose. </p>
