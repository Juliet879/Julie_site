        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Am a 21 year old from Nairobi,Kenya but originally from Kisii land.Am fascinated about life
            and I love learning.Am a lover of tech and love how tech is able to change so much using code.
            My life growing up has been full of fun experiences and also sad once but I choose to go with both because
            they have been n influence to what I am today.My dream is to change the my community and the world
            if possible with what I have and what I hold onto (belief).
            Am a believer ,and one of my beliefs ifs that everything happened for a reason,but the choice I make is a
            factor.

                <p>Have gotten an opportunity to study partly in the city and the surbubs ,am glad have tasted both of
                    the experiences
                    enough to tell stories.Before getting into tech my intrest was to get into the medics field and
                    become a doctor or
                    a nurse because I thought they looked cool in their work outfits and for-go my chance to pursue
                    Infortation Technology at Co-operative University.I later shifted after realizing I could not
                    sacrifice
                    a whole career lifetime for cool outfits and thats when I realized my passion for doing tech and I
                    followed it in 2020.
                    Am a software developer student ,a Diploma and my dream is to take my masters at Stanford
                    University.Am motivated to created an ecommerce application through
                    the skills I will have received by the the end of this program but I have a website already still a
                    working progress.
