                <p>Effia is born on the night of a raging fire in Fanteland. As she grows
                    up, her mother, Baaba, is cruel to her and abuses her, while her father,
                    Cobbe, is kind. When Effia turns twelve, she begins to blossom into a
                    young woman. She hopes to marry the next chief of the village, but Baaba
                    has other plans for her. She tells Effia to hide her blood, and then
                    contrives to have her marry a British man named James Collins who is
                    the newly appointed governor of the Cape Coast Castle. Before Effia is
                    married, Baaba gives her a black stone pendant—a piece of her mother.
                    Effia and James Collins are then married and develop sincere affection
                    for each other when she moves into the Castle. However, she quickly discovers
                    that there are women in the dungeons being traded as slaves. Though she is
                    horrified, she knows she cannot go back to her village, and only returns years
                    later when she hears her father is dying. When Effia is at her father’s
                    deathbed, her brother, Fiifi, reveals that she is not actually Baaba’s daughter.
                    Her real mother, Maame, had been a house girl for Cobbe, and ran away the night
                    Effia was born. The black stone from Baaba is really from Maame.
                    Meanwhile, Esi is trapped in the women’s dungeon in the Cape Coast Castle. Soldiers
                    come and go, groping the women and taking away their children. Esi was born in
                    Asanteland to a respected warrior, Kwame Asare. The Asantes had been raiding
                    other villages for years, capturing prisoners and taking them as slaves and
                    servants. Her mother, Maame, took one of these prisoners as a house girl,
                    but the girl (Abronoma) was not very skilled at housework and was often
                    beaten. Esi felt bad for her, and agreed to send a message to her father,
                    telling him where she was. One night, Abronoma’s father and other warriors
                    attacked the village, but Maame was too afraid to run. She gave Esi a black
                    stone, and Esi ran away. She was quickly captured and taken to the Castle,
                    made to walk for days with little water and food. Back in the dungeon, a
                    soldier pulls her out and rapes her before returning her to the prison. Days
                    later, Esi and the other women are taken onto a ship, but she loses her stone
                    in the dungeon.</p>
