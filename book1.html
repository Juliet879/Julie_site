        <p>“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long
            time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first
            place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a
            woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being
            raised solely for that purpose.The way my mother always explained it,
            the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls
            in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women.
            “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman
            who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</p>

            <p>From Abel's culture where men are treated with different kind of respect incluiding bowing down to them which Patricia mocked it 
                by going down nd cower,groveling in the dirt,Abel wanted to impose ideas on what he thought his family should be.
                Abel veined in Trevor and his mom's independence to an extent he stopped them from goind to church and to Yeoville to see Robert,Trevor's father.
                Patricia was not into bowing down to her husband to show respect rather told him to earn it and its then he found it to be an insult abandon
                began to get physical.I would say this is still a major issue upto date as men tend to view women to be less,because its not just Abel who lived in that belief 
                and culture ,but also the police ,who say Its a family thing after Patricia goes to report for assault.I believe women should learn their worth and 
                understand when to leave and that Its okay to leave.But what society does and where we women go wrong at some point,is 
                at times  is that we tend to be hold back by what society says,that women are responsible for keeping the homes together but when the home 
                breaks they will blame it on the women.

            <h2>Blog2</h2>
            <p>In the novel,Trevoh brings out how the use of humor has helped him make new friends and also helped get 
                out of difficult situations.
            </p>
            <p>One of them he uses language as a tool when two Zulu guys tried to close speaking in Zulu<i> "Asibambe le auntie
                yomlungu Phuma ngapha mina ndizoqhamka ngamuka kwake"</i> meaning "Lets get this guy,you go to the left and I'll cone behind you"
            But he turned and bounced it back to them ,that they should instead just go mug someone together,as if he was part of the plan</p>
            <p>Humor is also brought out when Trevoh and his mum Patricia were going home from church and got into a minibus where the Zulu guys 
               in the minibus threatened that they are going to teach Trevor's mom a lesson after being in another mans car 
               and the stereotype that Xhosa women are promiscous.Patricia throws Trevoh outside the moving minibus and She
               rolls up Andrew on herself like a ball she also jumps .Its funny how Trevor and his mom just starts running as if nothing had just 
               happened and the Zulu guys were suprised how a woman with small children could run so fast
            </p>
            <p>Another instance is when Trevor shitted in the house and threw it outside bin</p>
