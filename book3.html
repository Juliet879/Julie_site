     <p>"Young men today have been bombarded with images of wealth and success
         that tell them that buying the hottest car or the most bling-blinginâ€™
         jewelry is what they should be motivated by.There is an overwhelming
         sales pitch targeted at these young men that subliminally suggests
         that material goods are what makes them real men. I want young men
         to have knowledge of the things that bring them true empowerment: education,
         a strong sense of purpose, compassion, confidence, and humility, to name a
         few.It is no accident that I graduated from Brown University magna cum
         laude and received graduate degrees with honors from Harvard Law School
         and the Kennedy School of Government. My family taught me that doing my
         best, educating myself, and being in service to others were not optional
         and that having values and being truthful were not negotiable.I am living
         proof that these principles work. Through the letters in this book, I wish
         to pass on to other young men my grandfathers' legacies of education, hard
         work, determination, and success."
