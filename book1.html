                <p>“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long
                    time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first
                    place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a
                    woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being
                    raised solely for that purpose.The way my mother always explained it,
                    the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls
                    in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women.
                    “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman
                    who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</p>

                        <h2>Blog1  (Subservient Woman)</h2>
                        <p>From Abel's culture where men are treated with different kind of respect incluiding bowing
                            down to them which Patricia mocked it
                            by going down nd cower,groveling in the dirt,Abel wanted to impose ideas on what he thought
                            hisfamily should be.
                            Abel veined in Trevor and his mom's independence to an extent he stopped them from goind
                            tochurch
                            and to Yeoville to see Robert,Trevor's father.Patricia was not into bowing down to her
                            husband to show respect rather told him to earn it and its
                            then he found it to be an insult abandon
                            began to get physical.I would say this is still a major issue upto date as men tend to view
                            women to
                            be less,because its not just Abel who lived in that belief
                            and culture ,but also the police ,who say Its a family thing after Patricia goes to report
                            for
                            assault.I believe women should learn their worth ,know and 
                            understand when to leave and that Its okay to leave.But what society does and where we women
                            go
                            wrong at some point,is
                            at times is that we tend to be hold back by what society says,that women are responsible for
                            keeping
                            the homes together but when the home
                            breaks they will blame it on the women.I would say if us women empower ourselves with skills
                            and go out there
                            find what you can do,we won't have to be under men who disrespect us because we depend on
                            them for everything.
                            On Abel's case and also for the other men with the same character,women who find themselves
                            in a relationship with them,
                            they should take time to study them before making things official.For Patricia if only she
                            could have gone
                            to Abel's homeland before marriage and read the culture on how men treat their women and
                            what she was getting herself to
                            the fact being that Abel was so concerned about his friends and family's opinion,she would
                            not have married Abel.

                        <h2>Blog2 (Humor)</h2>
                        <p>In the novel,Trevoh brings out how the use of humor has helped him make new friends and also
                            helped
                            get
                            out of difficult situations.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of them he uses language as a tool when two Zulu guys tried to close speaking in Zulu<i>
                                "Asibambe le auntie
                                yomlungu Phuma ngapha mina ndizoqhamka ngamuka kwake"</i> meaning "Lets get this guy,you
                            go to
                            the left and I'll cone behind you"
                            But he turned and bounced it back to them ,that they should instead just go mug someone
                            together,as
                            if he was part of the plan</p>
                        <p>Humor is also brought out when Trevoh and his mum Patricia were going home from church and
                            got into a
                            minibus where the Zulu guys
                            in the minibus threatened that they are going to teach Trevor's mom a lesson after being in
                            another
                            mans car
                            and the stereotype that Xhosa women are promiscous.Patricia throws Trevoh outside the moving
                            minibus
                            and She
                            rolls up Andrew on herself like a ball she also jumps .Its funny how Trevor and his mom just
                            starts
                            running as if nothing had just
                            happened and the Zulu guys were suprised how a woman with small children could run so fast
                        </p>
                        <p>Back in Orlando East where Trevor's grandmother lived in a two bedroom house literally with everyone 
                            from the family,they used to share one toilet for the adjoining houses.The tiolets were so poor that Trevor
                            one day decide to shit on the Kitchen floor since Koko,her great grandmother could not be able to see her.
                            When he was done,he decided to place it at the botton of the rubbish bin and when the grandmother and Patricia
                             his mother came back and found it outside the bin after searcing,they thought someone had bewitched him.
                             Its funny how Trevor pretends not to know anything about him and when his grandmother calls the women for
                             prayers,Trevor makes a prayer that,that insident might be a big misunderstanding and maybe they shouldn't
                             be quick to judge
                        </p>
                        <p>At school Trevor uses humor to make friends,since he could not fit in most of the gropes and cliques
                            but only the poor black people .He finally found his niche and he learnt to move seamlessly between groups
                            he played sports with the jocks,talk computers with the nerds.He would pop to everyone and tell jokes
                            to them.He believed he could be part of any group that was laughing.
