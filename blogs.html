        <p>“Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long
            time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first
            place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a
            woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being
            raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it,
            the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls
            in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women.
            “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman
            who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</p>


        <h5 id="homegoing">Home Going</h5>
        <p>Effia is born on the night of a raging fire in Fanteland. As she grows
            up, her mother, Baaba, is cruel to her and abuses her, while her father,
            Cobbe, is kind. When Effia turns twelve, she begins to blossom into a
            young woman. She hopes to marry the next chief of the village, but Baaba
            has other plans for her. She tells Effia to hide her blood, and then
            contrives to have her marry a British man named James Collins who is
            the newly appointed governor of the Cape Coast Castle. Before Effia is
            married, Baaba gives her a black stone pendant—a piece of her mother.
            Effia and James Collins are then married and develop sincere affection
            for each other when she moves into the Castle. However, she quickly discovers
            that there are women in the dungeons being traded as slaves. Though she is
            horrified, she knows she cannot go back to her village, and only returns years
            later when she hears her father is dying. When Effia is at her father’s
            deathbed, her brother, Fiifi, reveals that she is not actually Baaba’s daughter.
            Her real mother, Maame, had been a house girl for Cobbe, and ran away the night
            Effia was born. The black stone from Baaba is really from Maame.
            Meanwhile, Esi is trapped in the women’s dungeon in the Cape Coast Castle. Soldiers
            come and go, groping the women and taking away their children. Esi was born in
            Asanteland to a respected warrior, Kwame Asare. The Asantes had been raiding
            other villages for years, capturing prisoners and taking them as slaves and
            servants. Her mother, Maame, took one of these prisoners as a house girl,
            but the girl (Abronoma) was not very skilled at housework and was often
            beaten. Esi felt bad for her, and agreed to send a message to her father,
            telling him where she was. One night, Abronoma’s father and other warriors
            attacked the village, but Maame was too afraid to run. She gave Esi a black
            stone, and Esi ran away. She was quickly captured and taken to the Castle,
            made to walk for days with little water and food. Back in the dungeon, a
            soldier pulls her out and rapes her before returning her to the prison. Days
            later, Esi and the other women are taken onto a ship, but she loses her stone
            in the dungeon.</p>

        <h5 id="letters">Letters To A Young Brother</h5>
        <p>"Young men today have been bombarded with images of wealth and success
            that tell them that buying the hottest car or the most bling-blingin’
            jewelry is what they should be motivated by.There is an overwhelming
            sales pitch targeted at these young men that subliminally suggests
            that material goods are what makes them real men. I want young men
            to have knowledge of the things that bring them true empowerment: education,
            a strong sense of purpose, compassion, confidence, and humility, to name a
            few.It is no accident that I graduated from Brown University magna cum
            laude and received graduate degrees with honors from Harvard Law School
            and the Kennedy School of Government. My family taught me that doing my
            best, educating myself, and being in service to others were not optional
            and that having values and being truthful were not negotiable.I am living
            proof that these principles work. Through the letters in this book, I wish
            to pass on to other young men my grandfathers' legacies of education, hard
            work, determination, and success."
            --Excerpted from the Introduction</p>

        <h5 id="women">Women Don't Ask</h5>
        <p>Women who run their own businesses must negotiate everything from consulting fees, to real estate contracts
            and rates for subcontractors, to their own benefit arrangements from insurance companies.”
            Women Don’t Ask, by Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever, is a widely lauded book about the personal and
            societal reasons some women find it hard to negotiate for more money at work and more help at home. As
            entrepreneurs, we’ve decided that our compensation should be determined by our ambition, skills, and
            opportunity (hopefully), but we know it’s equally, or more critical, for us to brush up on our negotiation
            skills to run efficient and profitable businesses.
            The book was written in 2003, and a lot has happened since then; women have founded #MeToo and #TimesUp,
            we’ve been part of the largest demonstration in U.S. history, and Beyoncé released Lemonade. Despite our
            progress, some of the same issues persist. Glassdoor released a report saying that women are still
            negotiating their starting salaries less than men. The Kennedy School at Harvard University published a
            study that suggested that female candidates are only likely to negotiate when prompted. The study supports a
            central tenet of the book, that men tend to recognize opportunities for negotiation in their lives more
            often, and that women tend to believe that their circumstances are fixed.
            We should say here that we don’t love the idea of resting the blame for the gender pay gap at women’s
            feet–it’s likely that employer bias and the motherhood tax play a more-than-significant role–but it’s worth
            thinking about the reasons for the discrepancies in these studies.
            According to the author, the book was not written to shame women but is instead stacked with case studies
            and statistics that exhibit societal norms and gender schemas that dissuade women from asking for what they
            want.
        <h6> The compounding effects of failing to negotiate early</h6>
        In surveys, 2.5 times more women than men said they feel “a great deal of apprehension” about negotiating. The
        women surveyed felt worried that asking for too much might threaten their relationships and felt less optimistic
        about what they could get from a negotiation.
        A thread throughout the book is the compounding effects of failing to negotiate early, which Stanford’s Margaret
        A. Neale summarizes for The Muse.
        “One of the things I ask my students is: If you think of a $100,000 salary, and one person negotiates and gets
        $107,000, and the other doesn’t—what’s the cost of that? In a simple-minded way, some people say, “Is $7,000
        really worth risking my reputation over?” And I agree, $7,000 may not be worth your reputation.
        But that’s not the correct analysis, because that $7,000 is compounded. If you and your counterpart who
        negotiated are treated identically by the company—you are given the same raises and promotions—35 years later,
        you will have to work eight more years to be as wealthy as your counterpart at retirement.”
        Similarly, if you take on a long-term client or customer for a low rate, you’ll have to work that much harder
        over the course of the relationship to get them to pay you what you or your product is worth.
        Taking an active approach to making change
        The book describes the idea that there are turnip people and oyster people. Turnip people approach life
        thinking, ‘well you can’t get blood from a turnip,’ and tend to accept their position as it is. Oyster people
        approach life with optimism and take an active approach to making change. The world is their oyster.
        “Life is full of opportunities, most situations are flexible, rules are made to be broken and much can be gained
        by asking for what you want.”
        It argues that socio-political and cultural influences mean that white men are more likely to see opportunity in
        the world because they have historically created, managed, and controlled the technologies and activities around
        us.
        The authors encourage the reader to look for opportunities to incorporate negotiation into the minutia of the
        everyday. You could negotiate a better deal for loan rates and approvals, professional fees, credit card fees,
        healthcare costs, hotel rates, and vacation packages. Expectations drive behavior, and we should raise ours
        right up.
        <h6>Set comparable goals</h6>
        Hannah Riley, whose work is cited in the book, told The New York Times that women earned 10 percent less in
        negotiations than men in comparable circumstances because they ask for less to begin with and the book suggests
        that women concede too much too quickly.
        “The higher the goal, the higher the first offer, the higher the negotiated settlement.”
        Of course, the key to every good negotiation is research. Ask your male peers what they would charge for a
        product or service, research the market rate, detail all the ways you or your product could benefit your
        counterpart. You could also study negotiation tactics.
        <h6>good news</h6>
        The book warns that women shouldn’t try to emulate men to be effective. Women tend to take a more collaborative
        approach–listening to the concerns of the other side, sharing information, figuring out new ways to solve a
        problem. That produces agreements that are better for both parties.
        The main message of the book is that there are more opportunities to negotiate than we might have been
        socialized to believe and that we should protect our value in the world.
        <h6>Criticisms and Omissions</h6>
        The book is fairly packed with examples of women not communicating or negotiating as well as the authors suggest
        they could have and is a little light on practical, actionable advice.
        Plus, the book feels dated in its approach to gender, with ‘Men are from Mars’ type generalizations making up a
        good chunk. On the one hand, it feels lazy, but on the other, it’s a positive sign for modern gender politics
        that the book has aged so quickly. Generic Asacol 400 mg online https://www.rpspharmacy.com/product/asacol/
        If the authors were to replicate the research in the late 2010s, they might like to consider how someone’s race,
        body shape, abilities and disabilities, sexual orientation or gender expression might affect their
        opportunities. It would’ve also been interesting to hear about how privilege affects negotiation as many of the
        original research subjects–postgraduates–appeared to have fairly similar backgrounds.
        The book was also subject to a pretty epic takedown by Jamie Strecker on FDIV.
        You might also like to read the Harvard Business Review article that suggests when women ask for raises at the
        same rate as men, they don’t get them as often. So asking isn’t a panacea and there’s still work to do.
        If you want to decide for yourself, it’ll probably be purchasable at your favorite feminist book shop (and also
        on Amazon, of course.)</p>
